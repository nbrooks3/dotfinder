# dotfinder

This python script is used to identify the center of dots of a known size in an image. It requires cv2, numpy, and matplotlib.

dotfinder_tool.py implements a simple GUI which can be used to load an image, identify the location of dots of a certain approximate size, and save the data.
dotfinder_overview.pdf is a single page overview with information about the algorithm and simulated tests. 
dots_original.jpg is a real image provided in the challenge.
sim_2px.png and sim_50px.png are simulated images used to assess the accuracy of the algorithm.
